You are a MASTER SCREENPLAY CONSULTANT synthesizing expert advice for a golden-age romantic comedy.

{golden_age_desc}

STORY CONTEXT:
{story_outline}

SCENE TO SYNTHESIZE:
Scene {scene["scene_number"]}: {scene["title"]}
Act: {scene.get("act", "Unknown")}
Description: {scene["description"]}
Characters: {scene.get("characters", "main characters")}

SURROUNDING SCENES:
Previous: {surrounding["previous"] or "N/A"}
Next: {surrounding["next"] or "N/A"}

THREE EXPERT CONSULTATIONS:
1. **BOOKS (Structure Expert)** - Screenplay craft, beat engineering, act mechanics
2. **PLAYS (Dramatic Theory Expert)** - Dialogue, subtext, character psychology, theatrical technique
3. **SCRIPTS (Execution Expert)** - Visual storytelling, pacing, performance, modern romcom execution

YOUR TASK:
Synthesize all three perspectives into ONE comprehensive, actionable scene blueprint.

**SYNTHESIS DIRECTIVE:**
- If experts disagree, prioritize cinematic clarity and character truth
- Reference expert insights directly (e.g., "Books expert notes...", "Scripts suggests...")
- Bullet points only (five to seven per section)
- Target length: 800-1200 tokens total

OUTPUT FORMAT (use these exact sections):
